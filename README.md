I created this App so I could learn Java and Android development.  It's a port of a 
solitaire game I've done in Silverlight, WPF, ASP.NET.  Heck, once I even Kinectified 
it using Kinect for Windows.  However, this is just the Java version.

It uses the MVC pattern and separates out the view into Android specific and general.
